// Whether a reduction is valid for ANY instance of its FROM problem (the actual
// mathematical definition of a reduction) is a fact about the CLASS, not about any
// particular instance -- so this is a type-level attribute, not an instance property.
// That matters concretely: a class whose default constructor is itself only valid on
// specially-shaped input (e.g. SipserReduceToSAT3, whose default ctor chains through
// `new CLIQUE()` and immediately calls reduce() on it) can't safely be
// Activator.CreateInstance'd just to ask it "are you general?" -- an attribute answers
// that via pure reflection over the type, no construction required. Apply to a
// concrete IReduction<,> class that implements the interface for some reason other than
// "this reduces any FROM instance to a valid TO instance" -- e.g. a solution-mapping
// companion to one specific other reduction (see SipserReduceToSAT3). Gates whether
// ReductionGraphData.Build() (Nav_Reductions.cs) advertises the class as a navigable
// /Navigation/Reductions edge; it does NOT remove the class from ProblemProvider.Reductions
// or /ProblemProvider/reduce?reduction=<name>, which construct by class name directly.
/// <summary>
/// Marks an <see cref="IReduction{T,U}"/> class as not a general reduction: its
/// <c>reduce()</c> is only valid for specially-shaped instances of the FROM problem, not
/// any instance. Excludes it from the navigable graph built by
/// <c>ReductionGraphData.Build()</c> (Nav_Reductions.cs) without needing to construct an
/// instance to check.
