Redux is a system designed to be an interactive, dynamic knowledgebase of computer science problems, reductions, and solution algorithms. Besides the backend knowledgebase and API, Redux also includes a (front end)[https://github.com/ReduxISU/Redux_GUI] with the ability to dynamically visualize these problems. The goals for Redux are to add functionality for the ease of crowd-sourced contribution of addition problems and visualizations, to add the ability to add and distinguish between problems other than NP-Complete problems, and to continue to expand the collection of problems, reductions, and solution algorithms.
