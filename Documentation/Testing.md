Testing is currently done using Xunit. While many problems do not currently have tests implemented or up to date, newly added problems should have tests included. And as time permits testing should be added to all existing problems. Tests should primarily verify that the verifier, solution, and reduction algorithms are returning the expected output given specific inputs.
